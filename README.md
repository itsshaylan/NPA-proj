## The Process
Mockup (attached) > choosing framework (Bootstrap) > ORGANIZATION

Organiziation is key. Divded document into sections, commenting in neccesary places. 
After that comes the basic and necessary tags.

Topbar: I knew I wanted to implement this because there's a lot of cluster when you implement it into the nav. The topbar contains the most important information therefore I wanted it to be at the top of the page.

Nav: The nav on the NPA site was big and busy. I wanted to go a direction in which it was clean, yet still provided all the information. Also not as huge. 

Intro: This is where all the focus is. Image is full width and edited with more empty space on the left side for promotional text. Your focus is on the promo code which is shown with a border. Text is big and easy to read with CTO underneath that leads to designated page. 

Footer: Made a 3 column section which replicates the original on the NPA site.

## The Goof
I started working on this project on day 2-3 of receiving it mainly due to work at my other job. As someone who is still learning, I designed for desktop first in mind. That was my biggest mistake. I don't have the most experience with working with responsive design and didn't have much time to implement it. As you will see when you resize the screen, element just kind of fall all over the place since I wasn't able to fix what I had created since I ran out of time. Mobile optimization is currently a weakness that I will combat with time and practice!
